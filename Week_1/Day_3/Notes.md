# Notes from Day_3 Lecture

#### Primitives
* strings
* booleans
* number
* null
* undefined 
* symbol
* bigint

#### Properties of Primitives

* Cannot be Mutable
* Are not an Object
* Stored directly in Memory (RAM)
* Prims are passed by referance, Not by values


### Objects

* Objects are a collection of Key/Value pairs

#### Square Bracket Notation -VS- Dot Notation
* Square Bracket Notation works 100% of the time
* Dot Notation has limitaions
* If you know what the key is called, Use Dot Notation
* If the Key is a variable of some kind, use Square Notation

#### Looping Through a Object
* CAN ONLY USE for...in Loop (which will return the keys)

##### Reminders about loops outside of Objects
* For...in loops will return Index's (similar to C-Style loops)
* For...Of loops will return the element in the array

### Extras
* Purpose of data stuctures are to contain similar data
