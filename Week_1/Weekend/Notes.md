### Automated Testing

Automated testing is the practice of writing code to programmatically test the actual code we want to write.

It offers several benefits over manual testing:

* it saves testing time (by not having to perform manual tests over and over)
* it saves debugging time (by catching bugs earlier)
* it makes it easier to program (because we don't need to keep the entire application in our heads, just the part that we're working on... if we break something, our tests will let us know)
* it makes it easier to come back to a program after some time (programmers forget things, but tests do not)
* it makes it easier to work together (we wrote some widget and know how it works, but our team-mates probably don't; our tests will catch bugs introduced by others on our team, and vice versa)
* it acts as documentation (readings tests is a great way to learn about how code is meant to be used)
* it improves the quality of our code (writing code that is easy to test often requires us to change how our code is structured -- for the better)
